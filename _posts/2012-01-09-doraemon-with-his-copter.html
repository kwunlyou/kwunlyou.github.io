<p>This is another blender modeling practice for Doraemon's copter. The course link is <a href="http://www.blendercycles.com/tutorials/windmill/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>P.S. The 3D model of Doraemon is from <a href="http://home.eps.hw.ac.uk/~ab226/software/ply/gallery.html" target="_blank">here</a> originally.</p>
