        <h4>Abstract:</h4>
        <p>
            Direct use of denoising and mesh reconstruction algorithms on point clouds originating from multi-view
            images is often oblivious to the reprojection error. This can be a severe limitation in applications which
            require accurate point tracking, e.g., metrology.
            In this paper, we propose a method for improving the quality of such data without forfeiting the original
            matches. We formulate the problem as a robust smoothness cost function constrained by a bounded reprojection
            error. The arising optimization problem is addressed as a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems by
            virtue of the barrier method. Substantiated experiments on synthetic and acquired data compare our approach
            to alternative techniques.

                    <b>Figure 1:</b> Starting from a converged bundle adjustment, our approach (left) searches for new
                    spatial position of the 3d point while guaranteeing that the reprojection error is bounded i.e. the
                    matches are maintained within a disk around the input matches. On the other hand, constraining the
                    smoothing within a ball around the initial spatial position (right) can lead to larger reprojection
                    errors as the shape of the corresponding projection (planar ellipses) is not taken into account.
