Download, compile and install <a href="http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/gotoblas2">gotoBLAS2</a> (NOTE: With new CPU,  it may have errors when compiling. We can get solutions by searching the errors information online).


Download, compile and install <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/">SuiteSparse</a>.

Just follow the manual then  everything should be OK.
Here is a demo which uses <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/cholmod/">CHOLMOD</a> as linear sparse solver.
