I am currently a data scientist at [IHS Markit](https://ihsmarkit.com/index.html). I analyze data from company databases to drive optimization and improvement of product development and business strategies for a variety of industries including financial services, economics, energy, maritime, etc. From 2013 to 2016, I was a research associate at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/). I was building a big data platform which was able to process massive amounts of geospatial data. From 2010 to 2013, I was a PhD researcher at the [ALICE](http://alice.loria.fr/) team of [INRIA (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation)](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/nancy). I carried out extensive research which proposed novel methods to process 3D data acquired by multiple cameras. I received my doctorate in computer science from [Institut National Polytechnique de Lorraine](http://welcome.univ-lorraine.fr/en).
