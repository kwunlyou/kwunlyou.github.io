      <description>I am currently a data scientist at IHS Markit. I analyse data from company databases to drive optimization and improvement of product development and business strategies for a variety of industries including financial services, economics, energy, maritime, etc. From 2013 to 2016, I was a research associate at University College London (UCL). I was building a big data platform which was able to process massive amounts of geospatial data. From 2010 to 2013, I was a PhD researcher at the ALICE team of INRIA (French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation).</description>
